The app project is WWDC15/WWDC15.xcworkspace<br>
The scheme should be WWDC15 Release (because WWDC15 itself has some handy jumpaheads for testing)<br>
Source is in WWDC15/WWDC15<br>
Fun comments are littered throughout the project.<br>

Special thanks to Jonathan Chan for moral support and being a coding buddy. This year is his first year trying out for WWDC and I really hope we can go together :-). :(UPDATE: rejected)

Also by the way, the intro screen is a scroll view, so you guys have fun with that haha. Took 10 days, so only 4 days left for the rest

Also, I really hope you guys dont steal the demo code for existing apps, thanks :-).
