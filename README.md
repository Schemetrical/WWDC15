#WWDC Scholarship Application by Yichen Cao

The app project is WWDC15/WWDC15.xcworkspace
The scheme should be WWDC15 Release (because WWDC15 itself has some handy jumpaheads for testing)
Enjoy. Also "Hello" is a nice file to read.
Source is in WWDC15/WWDC15
Fun comments are littered throughout the project.

Special thanks to Jonathan Chan for moral support and being a coding buddy. This year is his first year trying out for WWDC and I really hope we can go together :-).

Also by the way, the intro screen is a scroll view, so you guys have fun with that haha. Took 10 days, so only 4 days left for the rest
