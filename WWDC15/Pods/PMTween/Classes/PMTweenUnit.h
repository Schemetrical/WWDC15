By supplying a custom class to `structValueUpdater`, you can handle structs that PMTweenUnit doesn't support by default.

Additive animation allows multiple tweens to produce a compound effect, instead of overwriting each other as they update the same property. Additive animation is now the default behavior for tweening animations in iOS 8, and is great for making user interface animations fluid and responsive.
 *
 *  @remarks The `startingValue` property is ignored for additive animations, and will instead combine with the current value of the property being tweened. Please be aware that because of the composite nature of additive animations, values can temporarily tween past the specified endingValue. This can have unintended consequences if the property you are tweening is clamped to a limited range of values. Also note that additive animations may not work well with complex tweens using sequences, reversing, or repeating, and will not work with other tweens that are not using the additive mode. Because of these caveats, the default value is NO.
