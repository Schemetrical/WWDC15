 *  @param property      An NSValue property to be tweened. Supported properties include several NSValue-encoded structs such as NSNumber, CGPoint, CGSize, CGRect, CGAffineTransform, and CATransform3D.
 *  @param startingValue The property's starting value for the tween operation.
 *  @param velocity      The velocity value to use in the physics calculations.
 *  @param friction      The friction value between 0 and 1 to use in the physics calculations, with 1 representing very high friction and 0 representing almost no friction.
 *  @param options       A bitmask of `PMTweenOptions` configuration values. Defaults to `PMTweenOptionNone`.
 *
 *  @return A new instance of this class.

 *  @remarks If you need to tween an NSValue directly, without needing to update an object such as a UIView instance, using this method is adequate.

/**

 *
 *  @param object           An object whose property should be tweened.
 *  @param propertyKeyPath  A string keyPath that points to a NSValue property of the target object to be tweened. Supported properties include several NSValue-encoded structs such as NSNumber, CGPoint, CGSize, CGRect, CGAffineTransform, and CATransform3D.
 *  @param startingValue    The property's starting value for the tween operation.
 *  @param velocity         The velocity value to use in the physics calculations. Values from 0-10 are good for updating x/y positions.

 *
 *  @remarks If you need to update the property of an object such as a UIView, use this method. PMTweenPhysicsUnit will handle updating the object's property automatically if you have provided a valid keyPath to the property. For a keyPath to be valid, all objects or NSValue types must be supported. By supplying a custom class to `structValueUpdater`, you can handle structs that PMTweenPhysicsUnit doesn't support by default.
